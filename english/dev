Wiz_KeeD: can you give us some context?

Wiz_KeeD: 64-bit ubuntu?
Wiz_KeeD:  you made it executable?
yes sir 64 :(
Wiz_KeeD: As dcherniv_ points out, it must have the executible bit
uhm i did not dr_willis, how do i do that?
chmod +x foo.bin
just want to install the latest adobeair thingy
last i tried to install adobe air.. it failed badly.. ;)
I think they have stopped support for it for linux
@usr13 ok,i got it
Wiz_KeeD: You don't want to use the package manager?
Confucius: Good...
One of my Humble Bundle/Somthing Pack Games - used Adobe AIr for the linux port.. but the windows version worked fine in wine. ;)
Wiz_KeeD: it may be that you need to install i386 libraries for it to work (but if there's a package, use that)
no it's not that usr13 it's that i'm trying to install a time tracker from elance.com and they say that you should manualy go to the page and install that

/tmp/air.OfjHtq/setup: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Wiz_KeeD: I do not see anything about a time tracker at elance.com

Wiz_KeeD: Did you see what dr_willis sent you?  2 links....
i am checking out those and i ended up with the luink i pasted  you
is firefox known to run sluggishly on ubuntu in a vmware player?
hello. can anyone please tell me what is the difference between a normal and a -dev library?
Wiz_KeeD: O
?
0 what?
alegen:  the -dev packages are used when you want to compile stuff
alegen  -dev is developer, or development, no?
On 12.04, notify-send's -t option seems to be ignored.  Is there some way around this?
MonkeyDust: yes but what do they contain extra? or what is the basic difference?
Wiz_KeeD: Looks like maybe you are on the right track, ( http://jeffhendricks.net/?p=68 )
yeah i'm following that
hope i got the newest libraries though
alegen:  differnt lib  and .so and .a files - for example --> http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-12.04/ubuntu-main-amd64/lib32ncurses5-dev_5.9-4_amd64.deb.html
Wiz_KeeD: Usually, you can just link the older one to name of new one.
ah
Wiz_KeeD: I see it is showing one example.
alegen  or type apt-cache show some_package-dev
hi
those are a HELL a lot of libraries
is vdpau working well with unity 3d on nvidia card ?
mirak:  seems to work well with my nvidia card.
chreekat: why do you say that - it's fine here on 12.04
NVIDIA Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 530]
dr_willis: thanks i think i get it now
MonkeyDust: thank you as well :)
somsip: Hmm. I try "notify-send --expire-time=20 foo bar" and the notice stays up 10 seconds
dr_willis, do you have motion tearing ?
dr_willis, correct vsync, low cpu usage ?
mirak:  havent really noticed any issues.
ok
theres often compiz or other settings to fix many issues.
dr_willis, i will give it a shot maybe
chreekat: notify-sent -t 1000 test; notify-send -t 5000 test work as expected here. Perhaps there is a default and 20 milliseconds triggers it
all i do is watch anime. ;) so your mileage may vary
dr_willis, fullhd anime ?
mirak:  whatever i happen to have.
-t, --expire-time=TIME  Specifies  the  timeout  in  milliseconds at which to expire the notification. chreekat
Ive rarely seen Full HD anime. ;)
chreekat, seems you thought that was seconds
at least not where i get it from ;)
bazhang: OH no, I fully expected -t 20 to disappear immediately
but no matter what I put there, the notice is always 10 seconds long
guys it actually worked
thanks a lot dr_willis and usr13
it popped up when running the bin i was rather shocked
much apreciated :D
Hm that is worrying.  Now I have to wonder if i've somehow misconfigured something, somewhere
I wouldn't have the faintest idea where to look
but i still got a problem installing the timetracker
* chreekat safe-upgrades just to be sure
says it has a unmet dependecy with adobe air <=1.2.6
how do i check the current version?
Wiz_KeeD  apt-cache policy
then what?
Wiz_KeeD  what is "it"?
