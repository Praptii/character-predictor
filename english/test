Wiz_KeeD  what is "it"?
For some reason when I open a new terminal it doesnt automatically source my bashrc file. I have to type in bash or . .bashrc for my aliases to work. Is there a preference I can set to make this work?
any idea when the Cyborg Rat gaming mouse series will be supported?
cloudman, when someone writes a driver for it. best bet is to buy one and a case of beer for someone who can
escott, is that all it is then?
It sucks, but that's really how it works.
all I want is basic click function
it skips, darn thing
cloudman, its strange that you mouse doesnt support HID, but if it doesn't then someone has to write a specialized driver
will check some settings
Wait, it skips?
As in, it works to some extend?
animal, yeah sometimes its ok, but on full windows
then it stops at times etc etc
pain in the butt
If my notify-send does not work the same as others' notify-send, I must assume that somewhere down the line (in libnotify?) some configuration option is overriding the duration option
I don't understand.
Any pointers on getting to the bottom of that?
animal, I dont either, sometimes it works and sometimes not
Did it ever work (even partially) in ubuntu?
yes
using another at the moment
* Evil_Eric makes coffee for everyone 
cloudman, usually with these specialized gaming products the core protocol works (clicking and moving) but some added features dont (the heads up LED, the programmable buttons, the time reversal switch, etc)
Evil_Eric: thx :)
np
However escott, that doesn't seem to be the case here.

He said it sometimes do work, but all he desires is stable point/click-fucntionality
it will close this chat because its maxed size, but if I resize it, no chance
also for the 5 and 7 cloudman
thanks
how to login with a registered nick name
pls help
hey all -- stupid question.... in gnome-shell certain commands (eg., switching workspaces by key combo) leave me with a crosshair-like mouse cursor rather than an arrow, and i have to click in order to get focus back to whatever i'm doing.  anyone know how to fix this?  it's super annoying...
is firefox known to run sluggishly on ubuntu in a vmware player?
jValentin, how much memory alloted to it
2GB
arabi, /join #freenode for help
bazhang: 2GB ram, 60GB hard disk space
jValentin, how many tabs,etc is typical for it to get sluggish. what addons do you have for it
Have you used the VM long? And are you sure all your hardware/drivers register properly?
Firefox can run sluggishly even if the puter skips a propper gpu
originally, the whole thing would come to a crawl after leaving it idle for hours, when I exited firefox, I found it was quicker to respond, almost instant
animal, a VM does not use those same system drivers
bazhang: about 15 tabs, using the verticle tab manager addon
jValentin, whats the host, whats the guest
other mouse not working now, because I breifly used the Rat, geez
Bazhang, that depends on what you mean.
bazhang: it's called TreeStyle Tab, also the TabGroups manager
animal, video drivers. and so forth
host is Windows, guest is Ubuntu 12.04
cloudman, then check the link I gave you and find the fixes there
I've used VirtualBox successfully in the past, but wanted to try vmware because I'd heard it was more stable
when I run 'apt-get update/upgrade' I generate lots of errors, a la >> Setting up samba4 (4.0.0~alpha18.dfsg1-4ubuntu2) ...
Unknown parameter encountered: "map to guest"
jValentin, I'd find the plugins to be the culprit. try removing some, and see which has the greatest effect. some are not well written at all
Ignoring unknown parameter "map to guest"
how can I clean up apt-get and the various files it interacts with to eliminate these errors?
bazhang: I think you're right, was just wondering if Ubuntu had known issues or special reqs for running in vmware player
I wanted a portable development environment, thus the vmplayer solution
jValentin, not really. vbox has been the vm of choice for a while though. vmware has gone down a great deal in quality of the last several years
s/of/over/
Oh ho, look what I found regarding my notify-send problem: http://askubuntu.com/questions/110969/notify-send-ignores-timeout
hmm, that sucks, well, on Mac, vbox is slow, thus my switch
jValentin, well then disabling addons one by one seems the best way to get it back up to snuff
Greetings
Hm, maybe that's old news though
Is there a way to change the colour of the Unity sidebar? It picked a yellow-ish colour based on my background, but that doesn't really work too well.
must actually read it
bazhang: I will do that, thanks. On the question of virtual machines, I definitely need to know which is the more stable
when I run 'apt-get update/upgrade' I generate lots of errors, a la >> Setting up samba4 (4.0.0~alpha18.dfsg1-4ubuntu2) ...Unknown parameter encountered: "map to guest" ?? how can I resolve these?
the one great thing about vbox that I noticed is that it allows for viewing of paralles machines
bonez2046, what version of ubuntu. dual boot? wubi install or what
bonez2046  what's the exact command?
that would allow me to port my ubuntu vbox to my max
bazhang: ubuntu 12.04, no dual boot, just ubuntu.
bonez2046, any suspect repos or PPA in there?
MonkeyDust: command is 'apt-get install samba4' but it also shows up with 'apt-get update && apt-get upgrade' too
I am using grub-customizer; can't get submenu to work; grub menu always shows as a long single list w/o submenu.  Any ideas?
bazhang: I guess I COULD start paring away any suspect entries in there, but none seem problematic
MonkeyDust: I am trying to get samba upgraded and I noticed these when I ran apt-get install samba4
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=681048
Ok, this is annoying.  notification-daemon respects the timeout option, but notify-osd does not
Why would they do that
Hello.  grub-customizer; submenu not appearing; Grub1.99; any ideas?
oops; Grub1.98 not 1.99.
ciao
